<p> It contains a solution for bugs #1, #2 and feature requests #3 & #4 as reported in <a href="https://github.com/American-Water/aw-coding-challenge">https://github.com/American-Water/aw-coding-challenge</a>
The solution contains two UI projects, one in ASP.NET MVC and another in Angular 8 with .NET core 3.1. The angular UI uses AG Grid for displaying a grid with filter, sorting and server side pagination enabled.

The .NET core API uses Swagger as a tool for testing RESTful endpoints.
